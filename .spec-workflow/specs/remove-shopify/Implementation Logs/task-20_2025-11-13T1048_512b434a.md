### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Automated smoke script exercises catalog browsing, cart lifecycle (add/update/remove), collections, pages, and recommendations against the mock provider to ensure end-to-end flows succeed without Shopify.
- **Frontend Component:** scripts/tests/mock-integration.ts
- **Backend Endpoint:** lib/commerce/providers/mock/index.ts
- **Data Flow:** Script imports mock provider → sequentially loads collections/pages/products → drives cart CRUD operations → logs results for verification.

#### Integration
- **Description:** Recorded remaining blockers for Shopify provider testing (requires session cookies and Storefront credentials) plus current prettier check failures impacting pnpm test.
- **Frontend Component:** N/A
- **Backend Endpoint:** lib/shopify/index.ts / pnpm prettier
- **Data Flow:** Attempt pnpm test → prettier scans entire workspace including spec files → fails on unformatted documents, preventing automated integration confirmation.
